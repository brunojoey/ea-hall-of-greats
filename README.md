## Description
Every three to four months the Easy Allies compete against each other to try and get their own nominated game into the coveted Hall of Greats. Here you can see each Ceremony, Winners, Nominations, Allies, and a page for each Nominated Game. 

## Technologies Used
* React
* Sass
* Node JS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Material-UI 

## Future Development
* Finding a way to deal with games that are nominated more than once.

## Installation
To install this application you clone the SSH Key from the main hub page of this repository and you paste that clone link into your Terminal with git clone.

## Usage
To use this application you go to the deployed link available within this README file and you navigate through each page as you wish. All tables in each page are sortable and the person who brought it, or the ceremony, are clickable to direct you to that specific table. When you click on a game, you will be directed to that game's page which shows when it was brought to The Hall of Greats, the Ally who brought it, a description of the game, how many votes it received, most of the platforms it released on, the genre of the game, the year it came out, and the Metacritic score for it. If a game has been inducted into The Hall of Greats, three stars will be above the game's name.
